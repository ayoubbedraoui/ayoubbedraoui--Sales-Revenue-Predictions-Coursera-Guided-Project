# ayoubbedraoui--Sales-Revenue-Predictions-Coursera-Guided-Project
**Description:**

In this project, I will build and evaluate multiple linear regression models using Python to predict sales revenue based on advertising expenditures across various media channels like TV, radio, and newspaper.

I will utilize scikit-learn for regression calculations, pandas for data management, and seaborn for data visualization. The project begins with Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to gain insights into the dataset's characteristics and relationships between variables.

During the project, I will:

**Build Univariate and Multivariate Linear Regression Models:** Utilize scikit-learn to create predictive models capturing the relationship between advertising spending and sales revenue.

**Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Explore the dataset's structure, identify patterns, and visualize distributions and relationships among variables using seaborn.
Evaluate Model Fit and Accuracy: Assess the performance of the linear regression models using numerical measures such as R² and RMSE.
Model Interaction Effects: Explore interaction effects in regression through basic feature engineering techniques.
Platform and Tools:

The project is executed using Visual Studio Code, providing me with a familiar development environment for Python programming.

**1. Introduction and Overview** 🌟

  Provides an introduction to the project and outlines the steps we'll be taking to build and evaluate our linear regression model. It sets the context and helps us         
  understand the goal of the analysis.

**2. Load the Data** 📊

  This step involves loading the dataset containing information about advertising spending and sales revenue. It's essential because we need data to perform our analysis and build the predictive model.

**3. Relationships between Features and Target 📈**

  By exploring the relationships between different advertising mediums (features) and sales revenue (target), we gain insights into which advertising channels have the most significant impact on sales. Understanding these relationships helps us make informed decisions during model building.

**4. Multiple Linear Regression Model 🧮**

  Building a multiple linear regression model allows us to predict sales revenue based on spending across multiple advertising channels simultaneously. This step is crucial as it forms the basis of our predictive analysis.

**5. Feature Selection 🎯**

  Feature selection helps us identify the most relevant advertising mediums that have the strongest impact on sales revenue. By selecting the best predictors for our model, we improve its accuracy and efficiency.

**6. Model Evaluation Using Train/Test Split and Model Metrics 📝**

  Evaluating our model using techniques like train/test split and model metrics such as R² and RMSE helps us assess its performance. This step ensures that our model accurately captures the relationship between advertising spending and sales revenue.

**7. Interaction Effect (Synergy) in Regression Analysis ⚙️**

  Exploring interaction effects in our regression model allows us to understand if there's any synergy between different advertising channels in influencing sales revenue. This insight helps us fine-tune our marketing strategies and optimize advertising spending for maximum impact.

Each step in the process serves a specific purpose, ultimately contributing to our understanding of the relationship between advertising spending and sales revenue and helping us make data-driven decisions.

Notes:

I will need to have Python 3.7 installed along with necessary libraries such as scikit-learn, pandas, and seaborn.
This project offers a practical learning opportunity for individuals interested in data analysis, machine learning, and predictive modeling, with a specific focus on understanding the relationship between advertising investments and sales outcomes.
